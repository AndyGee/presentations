= Arquillian Universe Tour Script
Dan Allen

Prepared to be beamed up for a tour around the Arquillian Universe
I'm Dan Allen and this is Aslak Knutsen and we'll be your tour guides on this journey.

We're going to be taking the rather _dry_ and _boring_ topic of testing
and make it interesting
by involving aliens, drones, hi-tech materials and anything else we can find in the known universe.
(needs work) Perhaps the more exciting part is that we'll use these things to get a quick feedback loop for development

Start off with a couple of core principles that have helped shape the Arquillian Universe.

. Tests should be portable across multiple runtimes and/or target environments (servers, browsers, databases, etc)
. Tests should work in your IDE, where you spend your day-to-day life, and your build tools, which run in CI environments
. The Arquillian Universe should not reinvent the whole wheel, rather use what's out there, but make it more consumable and integrated

Move testing forward.

Integration platform for the JVM
Not limited to the Java language
JRuby, Groovy, Scala, which can reuse the Arquillian Core

Flexible
Extendable
Ready for today.
Prepared for the future.
